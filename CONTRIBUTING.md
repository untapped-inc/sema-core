# Contributing

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project! üéâüëç

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development

We like to follow <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank">Nvie's widely used Git branching model</a>. If you haven't yet, please, take some time to read it so you can get used to it. Basically:
- We have two primary branches: `master` and `develop`
- For new features, we create a new branch based on `develop` that we merge back into `develop` on completion. We can name it anything, except for the followings:
    - master
    - develop
    - name that starts with `hotfix-`
    - name that starts with `release-`
- For releases (once a set of features and bug fixes are ready to be released), we create a branch from `develop` that starts with `release-`, followed by the next version number. We merge it back into `develop` on completion.
- For hot/quick fixes (after a new release), we create a branch from `master` that starts with `hotfix-`, followed by the next version number. So if `master` was at version `1.0.1`, the next hotfix will be named `hotfix-1.0.2`. We merge it back into both `develop` and `master` on completion.

There's some more to it, so please, read the article carefully so your contributions don't get rejected.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2. Increase the version number in package.json to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of a maintainer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the maintainer to merge it for you.
